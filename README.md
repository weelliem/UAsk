## Prerequisites
It is recommended that you have the latest version of swift **5.0** upon the creation of this application an iPhone X 2018 was used. To check your deployable devices **Window > Devices and Simulators (Shift+Cmd+2)**.

## APIs
* **Google Firebase Firestore**
This is the real-time cloud hosed database for Firebase it uses and scalable NoSQL which stores data
as JSON.

* **Cocoa touch**
is the application development environment for building software programs to run on iOS for the iPhone and iPod Touch, iPadOS for the iPad, watchOS for the Apple Watch, and tvOS for the fourth-generation Apple TV, from Apple Inc. Cocoa Touch provides an abstraction layer of iOS, the operating system for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad. Cocoa Touch is based on the macOS Cocoa API toolset and, like it, is primarily written in the Objective-C language. Cocoa Touch allows the use of hardware and features that are not found in macOS computers and are thus unique to the iOS range of devices. Just like Cocoa, Cocoa Touch follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) software architecture.

 * **CocoaPods** 
API is a wrapper for the AFNetworking framework. API allows for easy API creation within one's app, so that time when can be saved.
 
 * **Xib files** 
usually specifies one view controller or menu bar. A storyboard specifies a set of view controllers and segues between those controllers. Unlike a xib, a storyboard can contain many view controllers and the transitions between them.
 
 * **UIkit**
framework provides the core objects that you need to build apps for iOS and tvOS. You use these objects to display your content onscreen, to interact with that content, and to manage interactions with the system. Apps rely on UIKit for their basic behavior, and UIKit provides many ways for you to customize that behavior to match your specific needs.

* **Firebase Authentication**
API provides backend services to support either your own custom user
authentication or using premade authentication tokens from Facebook, google or Twitter.
Firebase Recycler View Adaptor / Firebase UI Database
Firebase UI is a simple library that binds data from the real-time database to your applications. It
allows for easy population of recycle view by using firebase adaptors.

* **Firebase Storage**
This is basically being a cloud storage API which allows you easily to store and access data.

## Comments
This was my first iOS application using Xcode development along with swift. The use of Xcode prototyping tool was a new experience that I would recommend to new developers trying to develop an iOS application. 

## Credits 
This application was created as part of a group assignment for iOS development I would like to give acknowledgement to my team members [Megan](https://github.com/meganf00) and [Oliva](https://github.com/OliviaTad).
